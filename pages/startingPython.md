There are two modes you can write Python code in: **interactive mode** or **script mode**.  If you open up a UNIX command window and have a command-line interface, you can simply type `python` in the shell: 

>	python

and the **interactive mode** will open up.  If you store code in a file ending in `.py`, and execute the file in the **script mode** using 

>	python myscript.py
