NumPy and SciPy are modules in Python for scientific computing.  [NumPy]() lets you do fast, vectorized operations on arrays and [SciPy]() is a collection of mathematical and scientific modules built on top of NumPy.  

Why use these modules?  Because working with these modules gives you the performance of using low-level code (e.g. C or Fortrain) with the benefit of writing the code in an interpreted scripting language (all while keeping the native Python code). 

# Installation


# Import

>	import * from numpy
>	import * from scipy
>	from scipy import *

**Note**: SciPy includes most of NumPy, so importing SciPy should be generally OK.
