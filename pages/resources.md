The material for this tutorial was taken from various resources and tutorials found in books and on the web. I have provided a list of the ones that I have found to be most helpful.  

#### Books/PDFs on learning Python

* [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net) 
* [Data analysis for Python](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793) 
* [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) - Free book on the basics of Python
* [Think Complexity](http://greenteapress.com/compmod/) -  Picks up where Think Python left off. 

#### More interactive ways of learning Python

* [New Coder](http://www.newcoder.io)
* [Boston Python Puzzles](http://puzzles.bostonpython.com) - Cool puzzles posted by the Boston Python User group. Great if you are interested in setting up 'Project Nights' in your local Python community. 
* [codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - Interactive way to learn the basic Python syntax. A bit finicky on only accepting the **exact** solution, but overall a good experience if you like a hands on approach to learn to program in Python. 
* [How to think like a computer scientist: Learning with Python](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html)

#### Learn Python by example

* [Scientific Python Lectures](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) - Fantastic set of lectures on scientific computing with Python as IPython notebooks


#### Other fun resources

* [Matrix Cheatsheet in MATLAB, Python NumPy, R and Julia](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_matrix_cheatsheet_table.html)
* [Python one-liners](http://newdatascientist.com/blog/2013/08/04/python-one-liners/)
