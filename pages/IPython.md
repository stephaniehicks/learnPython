[IPython](http://ipython.org) is an *interactive* command-line tool for the Python programming language.  Some of the features include tab completion, shell syntax, data visualizations, tools for parallel computing. One of the more popular features is the [browser-based IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) which can combine code (and evaluate it), text, equations and plots all in one environment. The IPython notebook is similar to using [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com) when writing code in the [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org) programming language. 

This is a short introduction to using IPython
