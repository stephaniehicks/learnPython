Python is a useful high-level programming language to know for anyone analyzing data.  You may be familiar with another programming language such as [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org) or [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/), [SAS](http://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html), [SPSS](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/), [Julia](http://julialang.org) or [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), but [Python](https://www.python.org) is an essential language to know when it comes to [statistical software for data analysis](http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal). As there are many other statistical software tools out there, I wrote this tutorial assuming the reader has some previous background in at least one programming language and some statistical background.  The idea *what* things like `for` loops are will not be discussed, but rather the syntax of `for` loops in Python will be discussed.  The material for this tutorial was taken from various resources such as [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html), [Python for data analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793) and many other tutorials I found on the web.  You can find these resources at the bottom of this page.   

I break down this tutorial into sections. The first section contains the essentials of how to program in the Python language.  The second section is more focused on actual data analysis in Python.  I also want to mention this tutorial is currently evolving and I will add material to it frequently over the next few months.  If there is a topic you would like to see included in this tutorial, I would love to hear your suggestions.
